1. **Rearranged and Modularized Code in `main.js`**:
    - Modularized the code into separate functions for clarity and maintainability.
    - Introduced a `setupCamera` function for camera configuration.
    - Introduced a `setupControls` function for control setup.
    - Moved model loading logic into a separate `loadModel` function.
    - Moved the auto-rotate toggle logic into a separate `toggleAutoRotate` function.
    - Modified the model loading to show a spinner during the loading process and error messages if there's an issue.
  
2. **Added Feedback Mechanisms**:
    - Added a loading spinner (`loadingSpinner`) that displays while models are being loaded.
    - Added an error message display (`errorMessage`) to notify users when there's an issue with model loading.
    - Both of these are managed in the `loadModel` function.

3. **Integrated `sceneConfig.js`**:
    - Imported and used the `configureScene` function from `sceneConfig.js` to centralize scene configuration.

4. **Model Selection Enhancement**:
    - Stored the user's last selected model in the browser's local storage. When the user revisits the application, the previously viewed model is automatically selected and displayed.

5. **Switched Render Mode Selection**:
    - Changed render mode selection from a dropdown to individual buttons for a better user experience.
    - Integrated logic to remember the user's last chosen render mode using local storage.

6. **CSS Adjustments**:
    - Adjusted styles to accommodate the new render mode buttons and added a visual indicator to show which mode is currently active.

7. **Refactoring and Cleanup**:
    - Removed any duplicated or unnecessary code to streamline the application.
    - Ensured consistent and clear naming of variables and functions.
    - Enhanced error handling for better user experience.
